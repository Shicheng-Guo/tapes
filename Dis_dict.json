Cerulean cataract is characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Sutural cataract with punctate and cerulean opacities is characterized by white opacification around the anterior and posterior Y sutures, and grayish and bluish, spindle shaped, oval punctate and cerulean opacities of various sizes arranged in lamellar form. The spots are more concentrated towards the peripheral layers and do not delineate the embryonal or fetal nucleus. Phenotypic variation with respect to the size and density of the sutural opacities as well as the number and position of punctate and cerulean spots is observed among affected subjects. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10634616, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9158139}.

Charcot- Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet. By convention autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are designated CMT4. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17564959, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17564972}.

In some cases, it is associated with non- reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19535795, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23643382}.

Charcot- Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Neuropathies of the CMT2 group are characterized by signs of axonal degeneration in the absence of obvious myelin alterations, normal or slightly reduced nerve conduction velocities, and progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy. CMT2W patients manifest a peripheral neuropathy mainly affecting the lower limbs and resulting in gait difficulties and distal sensory impairment. Most patients also have upper limb involvement. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22930593, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26072516}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; ",

It is characterized by predisposition to illness caused by moderately virulent mycobacterial species, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, environmental non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and by the more virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other microorganisms rarely cause severe clinical disease in individuals with susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, with the exception of Salmonella which infects less than 50% of these individuals. Clinical outcome severity depends on the degree of impairment of interferon-gamma mediated immunity. Some patients die of overwhelming mycobacterial disease with lepromatous-like lesions in early childhood, whereas others develop, later in life, disseminated but curable infections with tuberculoid granulomas. IMD28 manifests early in life, with severe, often fatal, infection. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15924140}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; ",

Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry. HGPS is caused by the toxic accumulation of a truncated form of lamin-A/C. This mutant protein, called progerin (isoform 6), acts to deregulate mitosis and DNA damage signaling, leading to premature cell death and senescence. The mutant form is mainly generated by a silent or missense mutation at codon 608 of prelamin A that causes activation of a cryptic splice donor site, resulting in production of isoform 6 with a deletion of 50 amino acids near the C terminus. Progerin lacks the conserved ZMPSTE24/FACE1 cleavage site and therefore remains permanently farnesylated. Thus, although it can enter the nucleus and associate with the nuclear envelope, it cannot incorporate normally into the nuclear lamina (PubMed:12714972). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12714972}.; DISEASE: Cardiomyopathy, dilated, with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (CMDHH) [MIM:212112]: A disorder characterized by the association of genital anomalies, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism and dilated cardiomyopathy.

Opacities vary in morphology, are often confined to a portion of the lens, and may be static or progressive. In general, the more posteriorly located and dense an opacity, the greater the impact on visual function. CTRCT21 includes cerulean and pulverulent cataracts. Cerulean cataracts are characterized by peripheral bluish and white opacifications organized in concentric layers with occasional central lesions arranged radially. The opacities are observed in the superficial layers of the fetal nucleus as well as the adult nucleus of the lens. Involvement is usually bilateral. Visual acuity is only mildly reduced in childhood. In adulthood, the opacifications may progress, making lens extraction necessary. Histologically the lesions are described as fusiform cavities between lens fibers which contain a deeply staining granular material. Although the lesions may take on various colors, a dull blue is the most common appearance and is responsible for the designation cerulean cataract. Pulverulent cataracts are characterized by a dust-like, 'pulverised' appearance of the opacities which can be found in any part of the lens.

This condition usually presents with itching (especially on the lower legs) and visible changes of skin hyperpigmentation and thickening that may be exacerbated by chronic scratching and rubbing. Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis is often divided into macular and lichen subtypes although many affected individuals often show both variants coexisting. Lichen amyloidosis characteristically presents as a pruritic eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules with a predilection for the shins, calves, ankles and dorsa of feet and thighs. Papules may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic plaques that can resemble lichen planus, lichen simplex or nodular prurigo. Macular amyloidosis is characterized by small pigmented macules that may merge to produce macular hyperpigmentation, sometimes with a reticulate or rippled pattern. In macular and lichen amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in the papillary dermis in association with grouped colloid bodies, thought to represent degenerate basal keratinocytes. The amyloid deposits probably reflect a combination of degenerate keratin filaments, serum amyloid P component, and deposition of immunoglobulins. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:18179886, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19690585}.

Translocation t(3;8)(p21;q12) with constituvely expressed beta-catenin/CTNNB1. Fusion occurs in the 5'-regulatory regions, leading to promoter swapping between the 2 genes and activation of PLAG1 expression in adenomas. The chimeric transcript is formed by fusion of CTNNB1 exon 1 to PLAG1 exon 3. Reciprocal fusion transcript consisting of PLAG1 exon 1 and CTNNB1 exon 2-16 is also revealed in some adenomas (PubMed:9020842, PubMed:10029085).

Accumulation of these 3 amino acids and their corresponding keto acids leads to encephalopathy and progressive neurodegeneration. Clinical features include mental and physical retardation, feeding problems, and a maple syrup odor to the urine. The keto acids of the branched-chain amino acids are present in the urine. If untreated, maple syrup urine disease can lead to seizures, coma, and death. The disease is often classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms. The most common and severe form of the disease is the classic type, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Variant forms of the disorder become apparent later in infancy or childhood and are typically milder, but they still involve developmental delay and other medical problems if not treated. MSUDMV is characterized by increased plasma levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) apparent at birth. Treatment with a low-protein diet free of BCAA can result in normal psychomotor development and lack of metabolic episodes. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23086801}.

Charcot- Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet. By convention autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are designated CMT4. CMT4F is characterized by distal sensory impairment and distal muscle weakness and atrophy affecting the lower more than the upper limbs. The age at onset is variable and can range from childhood to adult years. When the onset is in infancy, the phenotype is characterized as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22847150}.

Hemiplegia of sudden onset and epileptic seizures constitute the prevailing presentation in childhood, while subarachnoid bleeding occurs more frequently in adults. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:21048783, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21799892}.

It results in the accumulation of sphingomyelin and other metabolically related lipids in reticuloendothelial and other cell types throughout the body, leading to cell death. Niemann-Pick disease type A is a primarily neurodegenerative disorder characterized by onset within the first year of life, mental retardation, digestive disorders, failure to thrive, major hepatosplenomegaly, and severe neurologic symptoms. The severe neurological disorders and pulmonary infections lead to an early death, often around the age of four. Clinical features are variable.

It showed hypermethylation and reduced ZNF713 expression. In the second family, 3 autistic siblings exhibited a heterozygous expansion of about 70 repeats, corresponding to premutations, which were partially or mosaically methylated. Mitotic instability of the premutation was observed in one affected sibling. In this family, ZNF713 tends to be up- regulated.
