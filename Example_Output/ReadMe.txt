This is an example output for TAPES.

It was generated using the data from:
 Zhang, J., et al. Germline Mutations in Predisposition Genes in Pediatric Cancer. N Engl J Med 2015;373(24):2336-2346
and random mutations in non-existing samples.

It is intended to demonstrate the output format of TAPES reports and does not have any biological meaning.
