Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

JIP and HHT are autosomal dominant disorders with distinct and non-overlapping clinical features. The former, an inherited gastrointestinal malignancy predisposition, is caused by mutations in SMAD4 or BMPR1A, and the latter is a vascular malformation disorder caused by mutations in ENG or ACVRL1. All four genes encode proteins involved in the transforming-growth- factor-signaling pathway. Although there are reports of patients and families with phenotypes of both disorders combined, the genetic etiology of this association is unknown. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15031030}.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes.

Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine- phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 > PtdIns(3,4)P2 > PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. The nuclear monoubiquitinated form possesses greater apoptotic potential, whereas the cytoplasmic nonubiquitinated form induces less tumor suppressive ability. In motile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods and thereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement.; 	DISEASE: Cowden syndrome 1 (CWS1) [MIM:158350]: An autosomal dominant hamartomatous polyposis syndrome with age-related penetrance.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

Required for the molecular mechanisms orchestration during intestine organogenesis; involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life, and promotes the formation of Peyer's patch-like structures, a major component of the gut- associated lymphoid tissue. Modulates cell adhesion via its cleavage by caspase in sympathetic neurons and mediates cell migration in an integrin (e.g. ITGB1 and ITGB3)-dependent manner. Involved in the development of the neural crest. Active in the absence of ligand, triggering apoptosis through a mechanism that requires receptor intracellular caspase cleavage. Acts as a dependence receptor; in the presence of the ligand GDNF in somatotrophs (within pituitary), promotes survival and down regulates growth hormone (GH) production, but triggers apoptosis in absence of GDNF. Regulates nociceptor survival and size. Triggers the differentiation of rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Also phosphorylates non- AMPK family proteins such as STRADA, PTEN and possibly p53/TP53. Acts as a key upstream regulator of AMPK by mediating phosphorylation and activation of AMPK catalytic subunits PRKAA1 and PRKAA2 and thereby regulates processes including: inhibition of signaling pathways that promote cell growth and proliferation when energy levels are low, glucose homeostasis in liver, activation of autophagy when cells undergo nutrient deprivation, and B-cell differentiation in the germinal center in response to DNA damage. Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton. Required for cortical neuron polarization by mediating phosphorylation and activation of BRSK1 and BRSK2, leading to axon initiation and specification. Involved in DNA damage response: interacts with p53/TP53 and recruited to the CDKN1A/WAF1 promoter to participate in transcription activation. Able to phosphorylate p53/TP53; the relevance of such result in vivo is however unclear and phosphorylation may be indirect and mediated by downstream STK11/LKB1 kinase NUAK1.

Regulates UV radiation-induced DNA damage response mediated by CDKN1A.

Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron- specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self- renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20418909}.; 	DISEASE: Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 16 (MRD16) [MIM:614609]: A disease characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats. Telomerase activity is regulated by a number of factors including telomerase complex-associated proteins, chaperones and polypeptide modifiers. Modulates Wnt signaling. Plays important roles in aging and antiapoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14963003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15082768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15857955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17026956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17264120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17296728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17548608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19188162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19567472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19777057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9389643}.; 	DISEASE: Note=Activation of telomerase has been implicated in cell immortalization and cancer cell pathogenesis.; DISEASE: Aplastic anemia (AA) [MIM:609135]: A form of anemia in which the bone marrow fails to produce adequate numbers of peripheral blood elements.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron- specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self- renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20418909}.; 	DISEASE: Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 16 (MRD16) [MIM:614609]: A disease characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation.

Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron- specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self- renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20418909}.; 	DISEASE: Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 16 (MRD16) [MIM:614609]: A disease characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone.

Acts by phosphorylating the T-loop of AMPK family proteins, thus promoting their activity: phosphorylates PRKAA1, PRKAA2, BRSK1, BRSK2, MARK1, MARK2, MARK3, MARK4, NUAK1, NUAK2, SIK1, SIK2, SIK3 and SNRK but not MELK. Also phosphorylates non- AMPK family proteins such as STRADA, PTEN and possibly p53/TP53. Acts as a key upstream regulator of AMPK by mediating phosphorylation and activation of AMPK catalytic subunits PRKAA1 and PRKAA2 and thereby regulates processes including: inhibition of signaling pathways that promote cell growth and proliferation when energy levels are low, glucose homeostasis in liver, activation of autophagy when cells undergo nutrient deprivation, and B-cell differentiation in the germinal center in response to DNA damage. Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton. Required for cortical neuron polarization by mediating phosphorylation and activation of BRSK1 and BRSK2, leading to axon initiation and specification. Involved in DNA damage response: interacts with p53/TP53 and recruited to the CDKN1A/WAF1 promoter to participate in transcription activation. Able to phosphorylate p53/TP53; the relevance of such result in vivo is however unclear and phosphorylation may be indirect and mediated by downstream STK11/LKB1 kinase NUAK1. Also acts as a mediator of p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis via interaction with p53/TP53: translocates to the mitochondrion during apoptosis and regulates p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis pathways. In vein endothelial cells, inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling activity and thus induces apoptosis in response to the oxidant peroxynitrite (in vitro). Regulates UV radiation-induced DNA damage response mediated by CDKN1A. In association with NUAK1, phosphorylates CDKN1A in response to UV radiation and contributes to its degradation which is necessary for optimal DNA repair (PubMed:25329316). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11430832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12805220, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14517248, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14976552, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733851, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15987703, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17108107, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18321849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21317932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25329316}.; 	DISEASE: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) [MIM:175200]: An autosomal dominant disorder characterized by melanocytic macules of the lips, multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and an increased risk for various neoplasms, including gastrointestinal cancer. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10408777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12372054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21411391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9425897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9428765, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9760200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9837816}.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine- phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 > PtdIns(3,4)P2 > PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. The nuclear monoubiquitinated form possesses greater apoptotic potential, whereas the cytoplasmic nonubiquitinated form induces less tumor suppressive ability. In motile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods and thereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement.; 	DISEASE: Cowden syndrome 1 (CWS1) [MIM:158350]: An autosomal dominant hamartomatous polyposis syndrome with age-related penetrance.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron- specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self- renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20418909}.; 	DISEASE: Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 16 (MRD16) [MIM:614609]: A disease characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation.

As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron- specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self- renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20418909}.; 	DISEASE: Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 16 (MRD16) [MIM:614609]: A disease characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes.

Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine- phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 > PtdIns(3,4)P2 > PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. The nuclear monoubiquitinated form possesses greater apoptotic potential, whereas the cytoplasmic nonubiquitinated form induces less tumor suppressive ability. In motile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods and thereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement.; 	DISEASE: Cowden syndrome 1 (CWS1) [MIM:158350]: An autosomal dominant hamartomatous polyposis syndrome with age-related penetrance.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats. Telomerase activity is regulated by a number of factors including telomerase complex-associated proteins, chaperones and polypeptide modifiers. Modulates Wnt signaling. Plays important roles in aging and antiapoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14963003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15082768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15857955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17026956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17264120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17296728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17548608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19188162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19567472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19777057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9389643}.; 	DISEASE: Note=Activation of telomerase has been implicated in cell immortalization and cancer cell pathogenesis.; DISEASE: Aplastic anemia (AA) [MIM:609135]: A form of anemia in which the bone marrow fails to produce adequate numbers of peripheral blood elements.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron- specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self- renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20418909}.; 	DISEASE: Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 16 (MRD16) [MIM:614609]: A disease characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation.

Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats.

Phosphorylates PTK2/FAK1. Regulates both cell death/survival balance and positional information. Required for the molecular mechanisms orchestration during intestine organogenesis; involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life, and promotes the formation of Peyer's patch-like structures, a major component of the gut- associated lymphoid tissue. Modulates cell adhesion via its cleavage by caspase in sympathetic neurons and mediates cell migration in an integrin (e.g. ITGB1 and ITGB3)-dependent manner. Involved in the development of the neural crest. Active in the absence of ligand, triggering apoptosis through a mechanism that requires receptor intracellular caspase cleavage. Acts as a dependence receptor; in the presence of the ligand GDNF in somatotrophs (within pituitary), promotes survival and down regulates growth hormone (GH) production, but triggers apoptosis in absence of GDNF. Regulates nociceptor survival and size. Triggers the differentiation of rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors. Mediator of several diseases such as neuroendocrine cancers; these diseases are characterized by aberrant integrins-regulated cell migration. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20064382, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20616503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20702524, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21357690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21454698}.; 	DISEASE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) [MIM:114500]: A complex disease characterized by malignant lesions arising from the inner wall of the large intestine (the colon) and the rectum.

Acts by phosphorylating the T-loop of AMPK family proteins, thus promoting their activity: phosphorylates PRKAA1, PRKAA2, BRSK1, BRSK2, MARK1, MARK2, MARK3, MARK4, NUAK1, NUAK2, SIK1, SIK2, SIK3 and SNRK but not MELK. Also phosphorylates non- AMPK family proteins such as STRADA, PTEN and possibly p53/TP53. Acts as a key upstream regulator of AMPK by mediating phosphorylation and activation of AMPK catalytic subunits PRKAA1 and PRKAA2 and thereby regulates processes including: inhibition of signaling pathways that promote cell growth and proliferation when energy levels are low, glucose homeostasis in liver, activation of autophagy when cells undergo nutrient deprivation, and B-cell differentiation in the germinal center in response to DNA damage. Also acts as a regulator of cellular polarity by remodeling the actin cytoskeleton. Required for cortical neuron polarization by mediating phosphorylation and activation of BRSK1 and BRSK2, leading to axon initiation and specification. Involved in DNA damage response: interacts with p53/TP53 and recruited to the CDKN1A/WAF1 promoter to participate in transcription activation. Able to phosphorylate p53/TP53; the relevance of such result in vivo is however unclear and phosphorylation may be indirect and mediated by downstream STK11/LKB1 kinase NUAK1. Also acts as a mediator of p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis via interaction with p53/TP53: translocates to the mitochondrion during apoptosis and regulates p53/TP53-dependent apoptosis pathways. In vein endothelial cells, inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling activity and thus induces apoptosis in response to the oxidant peroxynitrite (in vitro). Regulates UV radiation-induced DNA damage response mediated by CDKN1A. In association with NUAK1, phosphorylates CDKN1A in response to UV radiation and contributes to its degradation which is necessary for optimal DNA repair (PubMed:25329316). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11430832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12805220, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14517248, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14976552, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15016379, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15733851, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15987703, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17108107, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18321849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21317932, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25329316}.; 	DISEASE: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) [MIM:175200]: An autosomal dominant disorder characterized by melanocytic macules of the lips, multiple gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and an increased risk for various neoplasms, including gastrointestinal cancer. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10408777, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12372054, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21411391, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9425897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9428765, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9760200, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9837816}.

Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats. Telomerase activity is regulated by a number of factors including telomerase complex-associated proteins, chaperones and polypeptide modifiers. Modulates Wnt signaling. Plays important roles in aging and antiapoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14963003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15082768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15857955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17026956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17264120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17296728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17548608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19188162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19567472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19777057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9389643}.; 	DISEASE: Note=Activation of telomerase has been implicated in cell immortalization and cancer cell pathogenesis.; DISEASE: Aplastic anemia (AA) [MIM:609135]: A form of anemia in which the bone marrow fails to produce adequate numbers of peripheral blood elements.

Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron- specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self- renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20418909}.; 	DISEASE: Mental retardation, autosomal dominant 16 (MRD16) [MIM:614609]: A disease characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation.

Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development a switch from a stem/progenitor to a post-mitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to post-mitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron- specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self- renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity).

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages.

Evidence that this mechanism occurs in humans is provided by the identification of individuals in whom 1 allele of the MLH1 gene is epigenetically silenced throughout the soma (implying a germline event). These individuals are affected by HNPCC but does not have identifiable mutations in MLH1, even though it is silenced, which demonstrates that an epimutation can phenocopy a genetic disease.; 	TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Colon, lymphocytes, breast, lung, spleen, testis, prostate, thyroid, gall bladder and heart.; 	ovary;salivary gland;intestine;colon;parathyroid;fovea centralis;skin;retina;bone marrow;uterus;prostate;optic nerve;whole body;frontal lobe;bone;thyroid;iris;pituitary gland;testis;brain;bladder;tonsil;gall bladder;unclassifiable (Anatomical System);lymph node;cartilage;heart;islets of Langerhans;pharynx;blood;lens;skeletal muscle;breast;pancreas;lung;mesenchyma;placenta;macula lutea;visual apparatus;hypopharynx;liver;cervix;spleen;head and neck;kidney;mammary gland;stomach;	dorsal root ganglion;testis - interstitial;superior cervical ganglion;testis - seminiferous tubule;testis;ciliary ganglion;skeletal muscle;	0.71276	0.88182	0.512596355	80.29606039	1715.16552	7.63437	rs63750702	95490	Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colon_cancer|Hereditary_cancer-predisposing_syndrome|Lynch_syndrome|not_specified|Colorectal_cancer\x2c_non-polyposis|not_provided	MedGen:C0009405\x2cOrphanet:ORPHA443090|MedGen:C0027672\x2cSNOMED_CT:699346009|MedGen:C1333990\x2cOrphanet:ORPHA144\x2cSNOMED_CT:315058005|MedGen:CN169374|MedGen:CN221576|MedGen:CN517202	reviewed_by_expert_panel	Benign	0.329	0.359	T	0.001	0.395	N	0.979	0.427	D	2.1	0.585	M	-2.52	0.894	D	-1.3	0.36	N	0.034	0.829	D	0.625	0.868	D	0.031	0.534	D	.	.	0.924	0.554	D	c	0.075	0.255	1	0.42	0.707	0.73	0	5.93	0.959	5.691	0.677	1.199	0.96	1	0.715	1	0.888	16.432	0.836	DNA mismatch repair protein Mlh1\x2c C-terminal	.	.	.	.	0.0002	0.0002	0	0	0	0	0.0002	0	0.0003	6.54E-05	0.0004	0	0	0	0.0005	0.0002	0	GT	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/1	47	1	0	.	.	.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0.1	Likely Benign

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

These individuals are affected by HNPCC but does not have identifiable mutations in MLH1, even though it is silenced, which demonstrates that an epimutation can phenocopy a genetic disease.; 	TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Colon, lymphocytes, breast, lung, spleen, testis, prostate, thyroid, gall bladder and heart.; 	ovary;salivary gland;intestine;colon;parathyroid;fovea centralis;skin;retina;bone marrow;uterus;prostate;optic nerve;whole body;frontal lobe;bone;thyroid;iris;pituitary gland;testis;brain;bladder;tonsil;gall bladder;unclassifiable (Anatomical System);lymph node;cartilage;heart;islets of Langerhans;pharynx;blood;lens;skeletal muscle;breast;pancreas;lung;mesenchyma;placenta;macula lutea;visual apparatus;hypopharynx;liver;cervix;spleen;head and neck;kidney;mammary gland;stomach;;ovary;salivary gland;intestine;colon;parathyroid;fovea centralis;skin;retina;bone marrow;uterus;prostate;optic nerve;whole body;frontal lobe;bone;thyroid;iris;pituitary gland;testis;brain;bladder;tonsil;gall bladder;unclassifiable (Anatomical System);lymph node;cartilage;heart;islets of Langerhans;pharynx;blood;lens;skeletal muscle;breast;pancreas;lung;mesenchyma;placenta;macula lutea;visual apparatus;hypopharynx;liver;cervix;spleen;head and neck;kidney;mammary gland;stomach;	dorsal root ganglion;testis - interstitial;superior cervical ganglion;testis - seminiferous tubule;testis;ciliary ganglion;skeletal muscle;	0.71276	0.88182	0.512596355	80.29606039	1715.16552	7.63437	rs63750365	95170	Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colon_cancer|Hereditary_cancer-predisposing_syndrome|Lynch_syndrome|Lynch_syndrome_I|not_specified|Colorectal_cancer\x2c_non-polyposis	MedGen:C0009405\x2cOrphanet:ORPHA443090|MedGen:C0027672\x2cSNOMED_CT:699346009|MedGen:C1333990\x2cOrphanet:ORPHA144\x2cSNOMED_CT:315058005|MedGen:C2936783\x2cOMIM:120435|MedGen:CN169374|MedGen:CN221576	reviewed_by_expert_panel	Benign	0.481	0.082	T	0.037	0.244	N	0.993	0.24	N	1.87	0.498	L	-2.74	0.907	D	-0.33	0.154	N	-1.021	0.233	T	0.057	0.238	T	0.011	0.285	T	.	.	0.851	0.44	D	c	-0.614	-0.636	1	0.48	0.707	0.73	0	2.19	0.268	1.211	0.318	-0.733	0.036	0.883	0.308	0.002	0.062	5.812	0.176	Histidine kinase-like ATPase\x2c C-terminal domain	.	.	.	.	0.0008	0	0	0	0	0.0003	0.0016	0	0.0003	0	2.98E-05	0.0009	0	0.0004	0.0005	0.0004	6.50E-05	GT	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/1	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	47	1	0	.	.	.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0.025	Likely Benign

Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 8 (HNPCC8) [MIM:613244]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:19098912}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry. HNPCC8 results from heterozygous deletion of 3-prime exons of EPCAM and intergenic regions directly upstream of MSH2, resulting in transcriptional read-through and epigenetic silencing of MSH2 in tissues expressing EPCAM.; 	TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Highly and selectively expressed by undifferentiated rather than differentiated embryonic stem cells (ESC). Levels rapidly diminish as soon as ESC's differentiate (at protein levels). Expressed in almost all epithelial cell membranes but not on mesodermal or neural cell membranes.

Required for the molecular mechanisms orchestration during intestine organogenesis; involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life, and promotes the formation of Peyer's patch-like structures, a major component of the gut- associated lymphoid tissue. Modulates cell adhesion via its cleavage by caspase in sympathetic neurons and mediates cell migration in an integrin (e.g. ITGB1 and ITGB3)-dependent manner. Involved in the development of the neural crest. Active in the absence of ligand, triggering apoptosis through a mechanism that requires receptor intracellular caspase cleavage. Acts as a dependence receptor; in the presence of the ligand GDNF in somatotrophs (within pituitary), promotes survival and down regulates growth hormone (GH) production, but triggers apoptosis in absence of GDNF. Regulates nociceptor survival and size. Triggers the differentiation of rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

These individuals are affected by HNPCC but does not have identifiable mutations in MLH1, even though it is silenced, which demonstrates that an epimutation can phenocopy a genetic disease.; 	TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Colon, lymphocytes, breast, lung, spleen, testis, prostate, thyroid, gall bladder and heart.; 	ovary;salivary gland;intestine;colon;parathyroid;fovea centralis;skin;retina;bone marrow;uterus;prostate;optic nerve;whole body;frontal lobe;bone;thyroid;iris;pituitary gland;testis;brain;bladder;tonsil;gall bladder;unclassifiable (Anatomical System);lymph node;cartilage;heart;islets of Langerhans;pharynx;blood;lens;skeletal muscle;breast;pancreas;lung;mesenchyma;placenta;macula lutea;visual apparatus;hypopharynx;liver;cervix;spleen;head and neck;kidney;mammary gland;stomach;;ovary;salivary gland;intestine;colon;parathyroid;fovea centralis;skin;retina;bone marrow;uterus;prostate;optic nerve;whole body;frontal lobe;bone;thyroid;iris;pituitary gland;testis;brain;bladder;tonsil;gall bladder;unclassifiable (Anatomical System);lymph node;cartilage;heart;islets of Langerhans;pharynx;blood;lens;skeletal muscle;breast;pancreas;lung;mesenchyma;placenta;macula lutea;visual apparatus;hypopharynx;liver;cervix;spleen;head and neck;kidney;mammary gland;stomach;	dorsal root ganglion;testis - interstitial;superior cervical ganglion;testis - seminiferous tubule;testis;ciliary ganglion;skeletal muscle;	0.71276	0.88182	0.512596355	80.29606039	1715.16552	7.63437	rs63750447	50071	Lung_adenocarcinoma|Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colon_cancer|Hereditary_cancer-predisposing_syndrome|Adenocarcinoma_of_stomach|Lynch_syndrome|Lynch_syndrome_I|not_specified|not_provided	Human_Phenotype_Ontology:HP:0030078\x2cMeSH:C538231\x2cMedGen:C0152013|MedGen:C0009405\x2cOrphanet:ORPHA443090|MedGen:C0027672\x2cSNOMED_CT:699346009|MedGen:C0278701|MedGen:C1333990\x2cOrphanet:ORPHA144\x2cSNOMED_CT:315058005|MedGen:C2936783\x2cOMIM:120435|MedGen:CN169374|MedGen:CN517202	reviewed_by_expert_panel	Benign	0	0.912	D	0	0.843	D	1	0.81	D	2.64	0.775	M	-2.66	0.903	D	-5.62	0.912	D	0.518	0.908	D	0.722	0.905	D	.	.	.	.	.	0.973	0.74	D	c	0.897	0.84	1	0.747	0.707	0.73	0	5.67	0.876	7.336	0.783	1.061	0.807	1	0.715	1	0.888	15.91	0.792	DNA mismatch repair protein\x2c C-terminal|Ribosomal protein S5 domain 2-type fold|Ribosomal protein S5 domain 2-type fold\x2c subgroup;Histidine kinase-like ATPase\x2c C-terminal domain	.	.	.	.	0.0018	0	0	0	0.0341	0	0	0.001	0.0026	0	5.96E-05	0	0.0361	4.48E-05	0	0.0009	0.0002	GT	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	0/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	0/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	0/1	1/1	1/1	0/1	1/1	1/1	0/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	1/1	0	5	43				0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0.0059	Benign

The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.
