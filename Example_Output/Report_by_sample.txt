Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.

Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [MIM:151623]: Autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cancer of the esophagus remains a devastating disease because it is usually not detected until it has progressed to an advanced incurable stage.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15887124, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18178629, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon.

Recognizes the substrate consensus sequence [ST]-Q. Phosphorylates 'Ser-139' of histone variant H2AX/H2AFX at double strand breaks (DSBs), thereby regulating DNA damage response mechanism. Also plays a role in pre-B cell allelic exclusion, a process leading to expression of a single immunoglobulin heavy chain allele to enforce clonality and monospecific recognition by the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) expressed on individual B-lymphocytes. After the introduction of DNA breaks by the RAG complex on one immunoglobulin allele, acts by mediating a repositioning of the second allele to pericentromeric heterochromatin, preventing accessibility to the RAG complex and recombination of the second allele. Also involved in signal transduction and cell cycle control. May function as a tumor suppressor. Necessary for activation of ABL1 and SAPK. Phosphorylates DYRK2, CHEK2, p53/TP53, FANCD2, NFKBIA, BRCA1, CTIP, nibrin (NBN), TERF1, RAD9 and DCLRE1C. May play a role in vesicle and/or protein transport. Could play a role in T-cell development, gonad and neurological function. Plays a role in replication-dependent histone mRNA degradation. Binds DNA ends. Phosphorylation of DYRK2 in nucleus in response to genotoxic stress prevents its MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation. Phosphorylates ATF2 which stimulates its function in DNA damage response. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10973490, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12556884, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14871926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15916964, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16086026, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16858402, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17923702, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19965871}.; 	DISEASE: Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) [MIM:208900]: A rare recessive disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, dilation of the blood vessels in the conjunctiva and eyeballs, immunodeficiency, growth retardation and sexual immaturity.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Heterodimerizes with MLH1 to form MutL alpha. DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2- MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23709753}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 4 (HNPCC4) [MIM:614337]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.
