Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Other types of bladder cancer include squamous cell carcinoma (cancer that begins in thin, flat cells) and adenocarcinoma (cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids). Bladder cancer is a complex disorder with both genetic and environmental influences.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

The DDB1-CUL4- ROC1 complex may ubiquitinate histone H2A, histone H3 and histone H4 at sites of UV-induced DNA damage. The ubiquitination of histones may facilitate their removal from the nucleosome and promote subsequent DNA repair.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Binds to DDB1 to form the UV- damaged DNA-binding protein complex (the UV-DDB complex). The UV- DDB complex may recognize UV-induced DNA damage and recruit proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway (the NER pathway) to initiate DNA repair. The UV-DDB complex preferentially binds to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP), apurinic sites and short mismatches. Also appears to function as the substrate recognition module for the DCX (DDB1- CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (also known as CUL4-DDB-ROC1 and CUL4-DDB-RBX1). The DDB1-CUL4- ROC1 complex may ubiquitinate histone H2A, histone H3 and histone H4 at sites of UV-induced DNA damage. The ubiquitination of histones may facilitate their removal from the nucleosome and promote subsequent DNA repair. The DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 complex also ubiquitinates XPC, which may enhance DNA-binding by XPC and promote NER.

TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cancer of the esophagus remains a devastating disease because it is usually not detected until it has progressed to an advanced incurable stage.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cancer of the esophagus remains a devastating disease because it is usually not detected until it has progressed to an advanced incurable stage. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [MIM:151623]: Autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cancer of the esophagus remains a devastating disease because it is usually not detected until it has progressed to an advanced incurable stage. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [MIM:151623]: Autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which accepts ubiquitin from specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and then transfers it to substrates promoting their degradation by the proteasome. Recognizes activated receptor tyrosine kinases, including KIT, FLT1, FGFR1, FGFR2, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, EGFR, CSF1R, EPHA8 and KDR and terminates signaling. Recognizes membrane-bound HCK, SRC and other kinases of the SRC family and mediates their ubiquitination and degradation. Participates in signal transduction in hematopoietic cells. Plays an important role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis. Essential for osteoclastic bone resorption. The 'Tyr-731' phosphorylated form induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function. May be functionally coupled with the E2 ubiquitin-protein ligase UB2D3. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10514377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11896602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14661060, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14739300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15190072, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17509076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18374639, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19689429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21596750}.; 	DISEASE: Noonan syndrome-like disorder with or without juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (NSLL) [MIM:613563]: A syndrome characterized by a phenotype reminiscent of Noonan syndrome.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cancer of the esophagus remains a devastating disease because it is usually not detected until it has progressed to an advanced incurable stage. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [MIM:151623]: Autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cancer of the esophagus remains a devastating disease because it is usually not detected until it has progressed to an advanced incurable stage. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [MIM:151623]: Autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

RAF1 activation initiates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that comprises a sequential phosphorylation of the dual-specific MAPK kinases (MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2). The phosphorylated form of RAF1 (on residues Ser-338 and Ser-339, by PAK1) phosphorylates BAD/Bcl2- antagonist of cell death at 'Ser-75'. Phosphorylates adenylyl cyclases: ADCY2, ADCY5 and ADCY6, resulting in their activation. Phosphorylates PPP1R12A resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN. Restricts caspase activation in response to selected stimuli, notably Fas stimulation, pathogen-mediated macrophage apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11427728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15385642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15618521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15849194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16892053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16924233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9360956}.; 	DISEASE: Noonan syndrome 5 (NS5) [MIM:611553]: A form of Noonan syndrome, a disease characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, a downward eyeslant and low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

It also can metastasize to other parts of the body. The term gastric cancer or gastric carcinoma refers to adenocarcinoma of the stomach that accounts for most of all gastric malignant tumors. Two main histologic types are recognized, diffuse type and intestinal type carcinomas. Diffuse tumors are poorly differentiated infiltrating lesions, resulting in thickening of the stomach. In contrast, intestinal tumors are usually exophytic, often ulcerating, and associated with intestinal metaplasia of the stomach, most often observed in sporadic disease. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14534542, ECO:0000269|PubMed:3034404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7773929}.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Acts synergistically with SMAD1 and YY1 in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-mediated cardiac-specific gene expression. Binds to SMAD binding elements (SBEs) (5'-GTCT/AGAC-3') within BMP response element (BMPRE) of cardiac activating regions (By similarity). Common SMAD (co-SMAD) is the coactivator and mediator of signal transduction by TGF-beta (transforming growth factor). Component of the heterotrimeric SMAD2/SMAD3-SMAD4 complex that forms in the nucleus and is required for the TGF-mediated signaling. Promotes binding of the SMAD2/SMAD4/FAST-1 complex to DNA and provides an activation function required for SMAD1 or SMAD2 to stimulate transcription. Component of the multimeric SMAD3/SMAD4/JUN/FOS complex which forms at the AP1 promoter site; required for synergistic transcriptional activity in response to TGF-beta. May act as a tumor suppressor.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction.

Required for the molecular mechanisms orchestration during intestine organogenesis; involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life, and promotes the formation of Peyer's patch-like structures, a major component of the gut- associated lymphoid tissue. Modulates cell adhesion via its cleavage by caspase in sympathetic neurons and mediates cell migration in an integrin (e.g. ITGB1 and ITGB3)-dependent manner. Involved in the development of the neural crest. Active in the absence of ligand, triggering apoptosis through a mechanism that requires receptor intracellular caspase cleavage. Acts as a dependence receptor; in the presence of the ligand GDNF in somatotrophs (within pituitary), promotes survival and down regulates growth hormone (GH) production, but triggers apoptosis in absence of GDNF. Regulates nociceptor survival and size. Triggers the differentiation of rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors.

Binds to DDB1 to form the UV- damaged DNA-binding protein complex (the UV-DDB complex). The UV- DDB complex may recognize UV-induced DNA damage and recruit proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway (the NER pathway) to initiate DNA repair. The UV-DDB complex preferentially binds to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP), apurinic sites and short mismatches. Also appears to function as the substrate recognition module for the DCX (DDB1- CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (also known as CUL4-DDB-ROC1 and CUL4-DDB-RBX1). The DDB1-CUL4- ROC1 complex may ubiquitinate histone H2A, histone H3 and histone H4 at sites of UV-induced DNA damage. The ubiquitination of histones may facilitate their removal from the nucleosome and promote subsequent DNA repair. The DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 complex also ubiquitinates XPC, which may enhance DNA-binding by XPC and promote NER. Isoform D1 and isoform D2 inhibit UV-damaged DNA repair. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10882109, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278856, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11705987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12732143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12944386, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14751237, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15882621, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16260596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16473935, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16678110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18593899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9892649}.; 	DISEASE: Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E (XP-E) [MIM:278740]: An autosomal recessive pigmentary skin disorder characterized by solar hypersensitivity of the skin, high predisposition for developing cancers on areas exposed to sunlight and, in some cases, neurological abnormalities.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon.

Down-regulates GLI1-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:15367681, PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Down- regulates GLI2-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Part of a corepressor complex that acts on DNA-bound GLI1. May also act by linking GLI1 to BTRC and thereby targeting GLI1 to degradation by the proteasome. Sequesters GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 in the cytoplasm, this effect is overcome by binding of STK36 to both SUFU and a GLI protein (PubMed:10806483, PubMed:24217340). Negative regulator of beta- catenin signaling. Regulates the formation of either the repressor form (GLI3R) or the activator form (GLI3A) of the full length form of GLI3 (GLI3FL). GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and the latter translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A).

Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine- phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 > PtdIns(3,4)P2 > PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. The nuclear monoubiquitinated form possesses greater apoptotic potential, whereas the cytoplasmic nonubiquitinated form induces less tumor suppressive ability. In motile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods and thereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement.; 	DISEASE: Cowden syndrome 1 (CWS1) [MIM:158350]: An autosomal dominant hamartomatous polyposis syndrome with age-related penetrance.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages.

These individuals are affected by HNPCC but does not have identifiable mutations in MLH1, even though it is silenced, which demonstrates that an epimutation can phenocopy a genetic disease.; 	TISSUE SPECIFICITY: Colon, lymphocytes, breast, lung, spleen, testis, prostate, thyroid, gall bladder and heart.; 	ovary;salivary gland;intestine;colon;parathyroid;fovea centralis;skin;retina;bone marrow;uterus;prostate;optic nerve;whole body;frontal lobe;bone;thyroid;iris;pituitary gland;testis;brain;bladder;tonsil;gall bladder;unclassifiable (Anatomical System);lymph node;cartilage;heart;islets of Langerhans;pharynx;blood;lens;skeletal muscle;breast;pancreas;lung;mesenchyma;placenta;macula lutea;visual apparatus;hypopharynx;liver;cervix;spleen;head and neck;kidney;mammary gland;stomach;;ovary;salivary gland;intestine;colon;parathyroid;fovea centralis;skin;retina;bone marrow;uterus;prostate;optic nerve;whole body;frontal lobe;bone;thyroid;iris;pituitary gland;testis;brain;bladder;tonsil;gall bladder;unclassifiable (Anatomical System);lymph node;cartilage;heart;islets of Langerhans;pharynx;blood;lens;skeletal muscle;breast;pancreas;lung;mesenchyma;placenta;macula lutea;visual apparatus;hypopharynx;liver;cervix;spleen;head and neck;kidney;mammary gland;stomach;	dorsal root ganglion;testis - interstitial;superior cervical ganglion;testis - seminiferous tubule;testis;ciliary ganglion;skeletal muscle;	0.71276	0.88182	0.512596355	80.29606039	1715.16552	7.63437	rs367654552	138395	Hereditary_nonpolyposis_colon_cancer|Hereditary_cancer-predisposing_syndrome|Lynch_syndrome_II|not_specified	MedGen:C0009405\x2cOrphanet:ORPHA443090|MedGen:C0027672\x2cSNOMED_CT:699346009|MedGen:C1333991\x2cOMIM:609310|MedGen:CN169374	criteria_provided\x2c_conflicting_interpretations	Conflicting_interpretations_of_pathogenicity	0	0.912	D	0	0.843	D	1	0.81	D	3.565	0.936	H	-2.73	0.907	D	-5.74	0.877	D	0.879	0.954	D	0.865	0.955	D	0.613	0.966	D	.	.	0.987	0.857	D	c	0.865	0.84	1	0.983	0.442	0.072	0	5.98	0.971	5.717	0.679	0.932	0.445	1	0.715	0.997	0.653	19.221	0.938	Histidine kinase-like ATPase\x2c C-terminal domain	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	2.84E-05	0	0	0	0	0	6.27E-05	0	0	GT	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/0	0/1	0/0	0/0	47	1	0	.	.	.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0.8121	Likely Pathogenic

Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which accepts ubiquitin from specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and then transfers it to substrates promoting their degradation by the proteasome. Recognizes activated receptor tyrosine kinases, including KIT, FLT1, FGFR1, FGFR2, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, EGFR, CSF1R, EPHA8 and KDR and terminates signaling. Recognizes membrane-bound HCK, SRC and other kinases of the SRC family and mediates their ubiquitination and degradation. Participates in signal transduction in hematopoietic cells. Plays an important role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis. Essential for osteoclastic bone resorption.

RAF1 activation initiates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that comprises a sequential phosphorylation of the dual-specific MAPK kinases (MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2). The phosphorylated form of RAF1 (on residues Ser-338 and Ser-339, by PAK1) phosphorylates BAD/Bcl2- antagonist of cell death at 'Ser-75'. Phosphorylates adenylyl cyclases: ADCY2, ADCY5 and ADCY6, resulting in their activation. Phosphorylates PPP1R12A resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN. Restricts caspase activation in response to selected stimuli, notably Fas stimulation, pathogen-mediated macrophage apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11427728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15385642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15618521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15849194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16892053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16924233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9360956}.; 	DISEASE: Noonan syndrome 5 (NS5) [MIM:611553]: A form of Noonan syndrome, a disease characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, a downward eyeslant and low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

RAF1 activation initiates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that comprises a sequential phosphorylation of the dual-specific MAPK kinases (MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2). The phosphorylated form of RAF1 (on residues Ser-338 and Ser-339, by PAK1) phosphorylates BAD/Bcl2- antagonist of cell death at 'Ser-75'. Phosphorylates adenylyl cyclases: ADCY2, ADCY5 and ADCY6, resulting in their activation. Phosphorylates PPP1R12A resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN. Restricts caspase activation in response to selected stimuli, notably Fas stimulation, pathogen-mediated macrophage apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11427728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15385642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15618521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15849194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16892053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16924233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9360956}.; 	DISEASE: Noonan syndrome 5 (NS5) [MIM:611553]: A form of Noonan syndrome, a disease characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, a downward eyeslant and low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which accepts ubiquitin from specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and then transfers it to substrates promoting their degradation by the proteasome. Recognizes activated receptor tyrosine kinases, including KIT, FLT1, FGFR1, FGFR2, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, EGFR, CSF1R, EPHA8 and KDR and terminates signaling. Recognizes membrane-bound HCK, SRC and other kinases of the SRC family and mediates their ubiquitination and degradation. Participates in signal transduction in hematopoietic cells. Plays an important role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis. Essential for osteoclastic bone resorption. The 'Tyr-731' phosphorylated form induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function.

Down-regulates GLI1-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:15367681, PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Down- regulates GLI2-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Part of a corepressor complex that acts on DNA-bound GLI1. May also act by linking GLI1 to BTRC and thereby targeting GLI1 to degradation by the proteasome. Sequesters GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 in the cytoplasm, this effect is overcome by binding of STK36 to both SUFU and a GLI protein (PubMed:10806483, PubMed:24217340). Negative regulator of beta- catenin signaling. Regulates the formation of either the repressor form (GLI3R) or the activator form (GLI3A) of the full length form of GLI3 (GLI3FL). GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and the latter translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A). Required for normal embryonic development. Required for the proper formation of hair follicles and the control of epidermal differentiation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0P7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10559945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10564661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10806483, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12068298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12975309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15367681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22365972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24217340, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24311597}.; 	.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

The alpha subunit binds DNA and appears to have a role in the development of normal hematopoiesis. Isoform AML-1L interferes with the transactivation activity of RUNX1. Acts synergistically with ELF4 to transactivate the IL-3 promoter and with ELF2 to transactivate the mouse BLK promoter. Inhibits KAT6B- dependent transcriptional activation. Controls the anergy and suppressive function of regulatory T-cells (Treg) by associating with FOXP3. Activates the expression of IL2 and IFNG and down- regulates the expression of TNFRSF18, IL2RA and CTLA4, in conventional T-cells (PubMed:17377532). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10207087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11965546, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14970218, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17377532, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17431401}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving RUNX1/AML1 is a cause of M2 type acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M2).

Phosphorylates PTK2/FAK1. Regulates both cell death/survival balance and positional information. Required for the molecular mechanisms orchestration during intestine organogenesis; involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life, and promotes the formation of Peyer's patch-like structures, a major component of the gut- associated lymphoid tissue. Modulates cell adhesion via its cleavage by caspase in sympathetic neurons and mediates cell migration in an integrin (e.g. ITGB1 and ITGB3)-dependent manner. Involved in the development of the neural crest. Active in the absence of ligand, triggering apoptosis through a mechanism that requires receptor intracellular caspase cleavage. Acts as a dependence receptor; in the presence of the ligand GDNF in somatotrophs (within pituitary), promotes survival and down regulates growth hormone (GH) production, but triggers apoptosis in absence of GDNF. Regulates nociceptor survival and size. Triggers the differentiation of rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors. Mediator of several diseases such as neuroendocrine cancers; these diseases are characterized by aberrant integrins-regulated cell migration. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20064382, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20616503, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20702524, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21357690, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21454698}.; 	DISEASE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) [MIM:114500]: A complex disease characterized by malignant lesions arising from the inner wall of the large intestine (the colon) and the rectum.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication.

Down-regulates GLI1-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:15367681, PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Down- regulates GLI2-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Part of a corepressor complex that acts on DNA-bound GLI1. May also act by linking GLI1 to BTRC and thereby targeting GLI1 to degradation by the proteasome. Sequesters GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 in the cytoplasm, this effect is overcome by binding of STK36 to both SUFU and a GLI protein (PubMed:10806483, PubMed:24217340). Negative regulator of beta- catenin signaling. Regulates the formation of either the repressor form (GLI3R) or the activator form (GLI3A) of the full length form of GLI3 (GLI3FL). GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and the latter translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A). Required for normal embryonic development. Required for the proper formation of hair follicles and the control of epidermal differentiation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0P7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10559945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10564661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10806483, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12068298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12975309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15367681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22365972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24217340, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24311597}.; 	.

Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine- phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 > PtdIns(3,4)P2 > PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation.

Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine- phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 > PtdIns(3,4)P2 > PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue.

Promotes G0-G1 transition when phosphorylated by CDK3/cyclin-C. Acts as a transcription repressor of E2F1 target genes. The underphosphorylated, active form of RB1 interacts with E2F1 and represses its transcription activity, leading to cell cycle arrest. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases SUV39H1, SUV420H1 and SUV420H2, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Inhibits the intrinsic kinase activity of TAF1. Mediates transcriptional repression by SMARCA4/BRG1 by recruiting a histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex to the c-FOS promoter. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC1 repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex (By similarity). In case of viral infections, interactions with SV40 large T antigen, HPV E7 protein or adenovirus E1A protein induce the disassembly of RB1-E2F1 complex thereby disrupting RB1's activity. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15084261}.; 	DISEASE: Childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB) [MIM:180200]: Congenital malignant tumor that arises from the nuclear layers of the retina.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Cancer of the esophagus remains a devastating disease because it is usually not detected until it has progressed to an advanced incurable stage. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.; DISEASE: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) [MIM:151623]: Autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome that in its classic form is defined by the existence of a proband affected by a sarcoma before 45 years with a first degree relative affected by any tumor before 45 years and another first degree relative with any tumor before 45 years or a sarcoma at any age. Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats. Telomerase activity is regulated by a number of factors including telomerase complex-associated proteins, chaperones and polypeptide modifiers. Modulates Wnt signaling. Plays important roles in aging and antiapoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14963003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15082768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15857955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17026956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17264120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17296728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17548608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19188162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19567472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19777057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9389643}.; 	DISEASE: Note=Activation of telomerase has been implicated in cell immortalization and cancer cell pathogenesis.; DISEASE: Aplastic anemia (AA) [MIM:609135]: A form of anemia in which the bone marrow fails to produce adequate numbers of peripheral blood elements.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

Down-regulates GLI1-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:15367681, PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Down- regulates GLI2-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Part of a corepressor complex that acts on DNA-bound GLI1. May also act by linking GLI1 to BTRC and thereby targeting GLI1 to degradation by the proteasome. Sequesters GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 in the cytoplasm, this effect is overcome by binding of STK36 to both SUFU and a GLI protein (PubMed:10806483, PubMed:24217340). Negative regulator of beta- catenin signaling. Regulates the formation of either the repressor form (GLI3R) or the activator form (GLI3A) of the full length form of GLI3 (GLI3FL). GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and the latter translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A).

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Down-regulates GLI1-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:15367681, PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Down- regulates GLI2-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Part of a corepressor complex that acts on DNA-bound GLI1. May also act by linking GLI1 to BTRC and thereby targeting GLI1 to degradation by the proteasome. Sequesters GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 in the cytoplasm, this effect is overcome by binding of STK36 to both SUFU and a GLI protein (PubMed:10806483, PubMed:24217340). Negative regulator of beta- catenin signaling. Regulates the formation of either the repressor form (GLI3R) or the activator form (GLI3A) of the full length form of GLI3 (GLI3FL). GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and the latter translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A). Required for normal embryonic development. Required for the proper formation of hair follicles and the control of epidermal differentiation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0P7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10559945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10564661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10806483, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12068298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12975309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15367681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22365972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24217340, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24311597}.; 	.

Binds to DDB1 to form the UV- damaged DNA-binding protein complex (the UV-DDB complex). The UV- DDB complex may recognize UV-induced DNA damage and recruit proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway (the NER pathway) to initiate DNA repair. The UV-DDB complex preferentially binds to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP), apurinic sites and short mismatches. Also appears to function as the substrate recognition module for the DCX (DDB1- CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (also known as CUL4-DDB-ROC1 and CUL4-DDB-RBX1). The DDB1-CUL4- ROC1 complex may ubiquitinate histone H2A, histone H3 and histone H4 at sites of UV-induced DNA damage. The ubiquitination of histones may facilitate their removal from the nucleosome and promote subsequent DNA repair. The DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 complex also ubiquitinates XPC, which may enhance DNA-binding by XPC and promote NER. Isoform D1 and isoform D2 inhibit UV-damaged DNA repair. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10882109, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278856, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11705987, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12732143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12944386, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14751237, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15882621, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16260596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16473935, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16678110, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18593899, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9892649}.; 	DISEASE: Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E (XP-E) [MIM:278740]: An autosomal recessive pigmentary skin disorder characterized by solar hypersensitivity of the skin, high predisposition for developing cancers on areas exposed to sunlight and, in some cases, neurological abnormalities.

Down-regulates GLI1-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:15367681, PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Down- regulates GLI2-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Part of a corepressor complex that acts on DNA-bound GLI1. May also act by linking GLI1 to BTRC and thereby targeting GLI1 to degradation by the proteasome. Sequesters GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 in the cytoplasm, this effect is overcome by binding of STK36 to both SUFU and a GLI protein (PubMed:10806483, PubMed:24217340). Negative regulator of beta- catenin signaling. Regulates the formation of either the repressor form (GLI3R) or the activator form (GLI3A) of the full length form of GLI3 (GLI3FL). GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and the latter translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A). Required for normal embryonic development. Required for the proper formation of hair follicles and the control of epidermal differentiation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0P7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10559945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10564661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10806483, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12068298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12975309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15367681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22365972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24217340, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24311597}.; 	.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus. The most common types are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine- phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 > PtdIns(3,4)P2 > PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. The nuclear monoubiquitinated form possesses greater apoptotic potential, whereas the cytoplasmic nonubiquitinated form induces less tumor suppressive ability. In motile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods and thereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement.; 	DISEASE: Cowden syndrome 1 (CWS1) [MIM:158350]: An autosomal dominant hamartomatous polyposis syndrome with age-related penetrance.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas.

When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA- Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seem to have to effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1- mediated transcriptional activation of PER2 (PubMed:24051492). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11025664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12810724, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15186775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15340061, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17317671, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17349958, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19556538, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20673990, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20959462, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22726440, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24051492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9840937}.; 	DISEASE: Note=TP53 is found in increased amounts in a wide variety of transformed cells. TP53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in about 60% of cancers. TP53 defects are found in Barrett metaplasia a condition in which the normally stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus is replaced by a metaplastic columnar epithelium. The condition develops as a complication in approximately 10% of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.; DISEASE: Esophageal cancer (ESCR) [MIM:133239]: A malignancy of the esophagus.

Other clinical definitions for LFS have been proposed (PubMed:8118819 and PubMed:8718514) and called Li-Fraumeni like syndrome (LFL). In these families affected relatives develop a diverse set of malignancies at unusually early ages. Four types of cancers account for 80% of tumors occurring in TP53 germline mutation carriers: breast cancers, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, brain tumors (astrocytomas) and adrenocortical carcinomas. Less frequent tumors include choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma before the age of 15, rhabdomyosarcoma before the age of 5, leukemia, Wilms tumor, malignant phyllodes tumor, colorectal and gastric cancers. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10484981, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1565144, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1737852, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1933902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:1978757, ECO:0000269|PubMed:2259385, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7887414, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8825920, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9452042}.

RAF1 activation initiates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that comprises a sequential phosphorylation of the dual-specific MAPK kinases (MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2). The phosphorylated form of RAF1 (on residues Ser-338 and Ser-339, by PAK1) phosphorylates BAD/Bcl2- antagonist of cell death at 'Ser-75'. Phosphorylates adenylyl cyclases: ADCY2, ADCY5 and ADCY6, resulting in their activation. Phosphorylates PPP1R12A resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN. Restricts caspase activation in response to selected stimuli, notably Fas stimulation, pathogen-mediated macrophage apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11427728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15385642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15618521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15849194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16892053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16924233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9360956}.; 	DISEASE: Noonan syndrome 5 (NS5) [MIM:611553]: A form of Noonan syndrome, a disease characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, a downward eyeslant and low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes.

Acts as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, dephosphorylating tyrosine-, serine- and threonine- phosphorylated proteins. Also acts as a lipid phosphatase, removing the phosphate in the D3 position of the inositol ring from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-diphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3- phosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate with order of substrate preference in vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 > PtdIns(3,4)P2 > PtdIns3P > Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function. Antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival. The unphosphorylated form cooperates with AIP1 to suppress AKT1 activation. Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation. Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation. May be a negative regulator of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. The nuclear monoubiquitinated form possesses greater apoptotic potential, whereas the cytoplasmic nonubiquitinated form induces less tumor suppressive ability. In motile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods and thereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement.; 	DISEASE: Cowden syndrome 1 (CWS1) [MIM:158350]: An autosomal dominant hamartomatous polyposis syndrome with age-related penetrance.

Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats. Telomerase activity is regulated by a number of factors including telomerase complex-associated proteins, chaperones and polypeptide modifiers. Modulates Wnt signaling. Plays important roles in aging and antiapoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14963003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15082768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15857955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17026956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17264120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17296728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17548608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19188162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19567472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19777057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9389643}.; 	DISEASE: Note=Activation of telomerase has been implicated in cell immortalization and cancer cell pathogenesis.; DISEASE: Aplastic anemia (AA) [MIM:609135]: A form of anemia in which the bone marrow fails to produce adequate numbers of peripheral blood elements.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Down-regulates GLI1-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:15367681, PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Down- regulates GLI2-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Part of a corepressor complex that acts on DNA-bound GLI1. May also act by linking GLI1 to BTRC and thereby targeting GLI1 to degradation by the proteasome. Sequesters GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 in the cytoplasm, this effect is overcome by binding of STK36 to both SUFU and a GLI protein (PubMed:10806483, PubMed:24217340). Negative regulator of beta- catenin signaling. Regulates the formation of either the repressor form (GLI3R) or the activator form (GLI3A) of the full length form of GLI3 (GLI3FL). GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and the latter translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A). Required for normal embryonic development. Required for the proper formation of hair follicles and the control of epidermal differentiation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0P7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10559945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10564661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10806483, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12068298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12975309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15367681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22365972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24217340, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24311597}.; 	.

Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats.

Areas of skin hypopigmentation have also been reported in MMRCS patients. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:7661930}. Note=The gene represented in this entry may be involved in disease pathogenesis.; DISEASE: Gastric cancer (GASC) [MIM:613659]: A malignant disease which starts in the stomach, can spread to the esophagus or the small intestine, and can extend through the stomach wall to nearby lymph nodes and organs. It also can metastasize to other parts of the body. The term gastric cancer or gastric carcinoma refers to adenocarcinoma of the stomach that accounts for most of all gastric malignant tumors. Two main histologic types are recognized, diffuse type and intestinal type carcinomas. Diffuse tumors are poorly differentiated infiltrating lesions, resulting in thickening of the stomach. In contrast, intestinal tumors are usually exophytic, often ulcerating, and associated with intestinal metaplasia of the stomach, most often observed in sporadic disease.

Active in progenitor and cancer cells. Inactive, or very low activity, in normal somatic cells. Catalytic component of the teleromerase holoenzyme complex whose main activity is the elongation of telomeres by acting as a reverse transcriptase that adds simple sequence repeats to chromosome ends by copying a template sequence within the RNA component of the enzyme. Catalyzes the RNA- dependent extension of 3'-chromosomal termini with the 6- nucleotide telomeric repeat unit, 5'-TTAGGG-3'. The catalytic cycle involves primer binding, primer extension and release of product once the template boundary has been reached or nascent product translocation followed by further extension. More active on substrates containing 2 or 3 telomeric repeats. Telomerase activity is regulated by a number of factors including telomerase complex-associated proteins, chaperones and polypeptide modifiers. Modulates Wnt signaling. Plays important roles in aging and antiapoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:14963003, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15082768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15857955, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17026956, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17264120, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17296728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17548608, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19188162, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19567472, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19571879, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19777057, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9389643}.; 	DISEASE: Note=Activation of telomerase has been implicated in cell immortalization and cancer cell pathogenesis.; DISEASE: Aplastic anemia (AA) [MIM:609135]: A form of anemia in which the bone marrow fails to produce adequate numbers of peripheral blood elements.

Down-regulates GLI1-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:15367681, PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Down- regulates GLI2-mediated transactivation of target genes (PubMed:24311597, PubMed:24217340). Part of a corepressor complex that acts on DNA-bound GLI1. May also act by linking GLI1 to BTRC and thereby targeting GLI1 to degradation by the proteasome. Sequesters GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3 in the cytoplasm, this effect is overcome by binding of STK36 to both SUFU and a GLI protein (PubMed:10806483, PubMed:24217340). Negative regulator of beta- catenin signaling. Regulates the formation of either the repressor form (GLI3R) or the activator form (GLI3A) of the full length form of GLI3 (GLI3FL). GLI3FL is complexed with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is maintained in a neutral state. Without the Hh signal, the SUFU-GLI3 complex is recruited to cilia, leading to the efficient processing of GLI3FL into GLI3R. When Hh signaling is initiated, SUFU dissociates from GLI3FL and the latter translocates to the nucleus, where it is phosphorylated, destabilized, and converted to a transcriptional activator (GLI3A). Required for normal embryonic development. Required for the proper formation of hair follicles and the control of epidermal differentiation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9Z0P7, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10559945, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10564661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10806483, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12068298, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12975309, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15367681, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22365972, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24217340, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24311597}.; 	.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds to DDB1 to form the UV- damaged DNA-binding protein complex (the UV-DDB complex). The UV- DDB complex may recognize UV-induced DNA damage and recruit proteins of the nucleotide excision repair pathway (the NER pathway) to initiate DNA repair. The UV-DDB complex preferentially binds to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP), apurinic sites and short mismatches. Also appears to function as the substrate recognition module for the DCX (DDB1- CUL4-X-box) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 (also known as CUL4-DDB-ROC1 and CUL4-DDB-RBX1). The DDB1-CUL4- ROC1 complex may ubiquitinate histone H2A, histone H3 and histone H4 at sites of UV-induced DNA damage. The ubiquitination of histones may facilitate their removal from the nucleosome and promote subsequent DNA repair. The DDB1-CUL4-ROC1 complex also ubiquitinates XPC, which may enhance DNA-binding by XPC and promote NER.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Transduces signals from ligands at the cell surface, through specific activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phosphorylates almost exclusively at the first tyrosine of the Y-x-x-x-Y-Y motif. Following activation by ligand, ALK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL, FRS2, IRS1 and SHC1, as well as of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Acts as a receptor for ligands pleiotrophin (PTN), a secreted growth factor, and midkine (MDK), a PTN-related factor, thus participating in PTN and MDK signal transduction. PTN-binding induces MAPK pathway activation, which is important for the anti-apoptotic signaling of PTN and regulation of cell proliferation. MDK-binding induces phosphorylation of the ALK target insulin receptor substrate (IRS1), activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3-kinase, resulting also in cell proliferation induction. Drives NF-kappa-B activation, probably through IRS1 and the activation of the AKT serine/threonine kinase. Recruitment of IRS1 to activated ALK and the activation of NF-kappa-B are essential for the autocrine growth and survival signaling of MDK. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11121404, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11278720, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11387242, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11809760, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12107166, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12122009, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15226403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15908427, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16317043, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16878150, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17274988}.; 	DISEASE: Note=A chromosomal aberration involving ALK is found in a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, which accepts ubiquitin from specific E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, and then transfers it to substrates promoting their degradation by the proteasome. Recognizes activated receptor tyrosine kinases, including KIT, FLT1, FGFR1, FGFR2, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, EGFR, CSF1R, EPHA8 and KDR and terminates signaling. Recognizes membrane-bound HCK, SRC and other kinases of the SRC family and mediates their ubiquitination and degradation. Participates in signal transduction in hematopoietic cells. Plays an important role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and apoptosis. Essential for osteoclastic bone resorption. The 'Tyr-731' phosphorylated form induces the activation and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to the cell membrane in a signaling pathway that is critical for osteoclast function. May be functionally coupled with the E2 ubiquitin-protein ligase UB2D3. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10514377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11896602, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14661060, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14739300, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15190072, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17509076, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18374639, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19689429, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21596750}.; 	DISEASE: Noonan syndrome-like disorder with or without juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (NSLL) [MIM:613563]: A syndrome characterized by a phenotype reminiscent of Noonan syndrome.

Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs, and recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. Recruited on chromatin in G1 and early S phase via its PWWP domain that specifically binds trimethylated 'Lys-36' of histone H3 (H3K36me3): early recruitment to chromatin to be replicated allowing a quick identification of mismatch repair to initiate the DNA mismatch repair reaction. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23622243, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 5 (HNPCC5) [MIM:614350]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10480359, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10521294, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11586295, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14974087, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9354786}.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

DNA repair is initiated by MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6) or MutS beta (MSH2-MSH6) binding to a dsDNA mismatch, then MutL alpha is recruited to the heteroduplex. Assembly of the MutL-MutS- heteroduplex ternary complex in presence of RFC and PCNA is sufficient to activate endonuclease activity of PMS2. It introduces single-strand breaks near the mismatch and thus generates new entry points for the exonuclease EXO1 to degrade the strand containing the mismatch. DNA methylation would prevent cleavage and therefore assure that only the newly mutated DNA strand is going to be corrected. MutL alpha (MLH1-PMS2) interacts physically with the clamp loader subunits of DNA polymerase III, suggesting that it may play a role to recruit the DNA polymerase III to the site of the MMR. Also implicated in DNA damage signaling, a process which induces cell cycle arrest and can lead to apoptosis in case of major DNA damages. Heterodimerizes with MLH3 to form MutL gamma which plays a role in meiosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16873062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18206974}.; 	DISEASE: Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) [MIM:276300]: An autosomal recessive, rare, childhood cancer predisposition syndrome encompassing a broad tumor spectrum.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

RAF1 activation initiates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that comprises a sequential phosphorylation of the dual-specific MAPK kinases (MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2). The phosphorylated form of RAF1 (on residues Ser-338 and Ser-339, by PAK1) phosphorylates BAD/Bcl2- antagonist of cell death at 'Ser-75'. Phosphorylates adenylyl cyclases: ADCY2, ADCY5 and ADCY6, resulting in their activation. Phosphorylates PPP1R12A resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN. Restricts caspase activation in response to selected stimuli, notably Fas stimulation, pathogen-mediated macrophage apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11427728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15385642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15618521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15849194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16892053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16924233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9360956}.; 	DISEASE: Noonan syndrome 5 (NS5) [MIM:611553]: A form of Noonan syndrome, a disease characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, a downward eyeslant and low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability. Silencing of BRCA2 promotes R-loop accumulation at actively transcribed genes in replicating and non-replicating cells, suggesting that BRCA2 mediates the control of R-loop associated genomic instability, independently of its known role in homologous recombination (PubMed:24896180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:15115758, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15199141, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15671039, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18317453, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729832, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729858, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20729859, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21084279, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24485656, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24896180}.; 	DISEASE: Breast cancer (BC) [MIM:114480]: A common malignancy originating from breast epithelial tissue.

Phosphorylates PTK2/FAK1. Regulates both cell death/survival balance and positional information. Required for the molecular mechanisms orchestration during intestine organogenesis; involved in the development of enteric nervous system and renal organogenesis during embryonic life, and promotes the formation of Peyer's patch-like structures, a major component of the gut- associated lymphoid tissue. Modulates cell adhesion via its cleavage by caspase in sympathetic neurons and mediates cell migration in an integrin (e.g. ITGB1 and ITGB3)-dependent manner. Involved in the development of the neural crest. Active in the absence of ligand, triggering apoptosis through a mechanism that requires receptor intracellular caspase cleavage. Acts as a dependence receptor; in the presence of the ligand GDNF in somatotrophs (within pituitary), promotes survival and down regulates growth hormone (GH) production, but triggers apoptosis in absence of GDNF. Regulates nociceptor survival and size. Triggers the differentiation of rapidly adapting (RA) mechanoreceptors.

Binds RAD51 and potentiates recombinational DNA repair by promoting assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Acts by targeting RAD51 to ssDNA over double-stranded DNA, enabling RAD51 to displace replication protein-A (RPA) from ssDNA and stabilizing RAD51-ssDNA filaments by blocking ATP hydrolysis. Part of a PALB2-scaffolded HR complex containing RAD51C and which is thought to play a role in DNA repair by HR. May participate in S phase checkpoint activation. Binds selectively to ssDNA, and to ssDNA in tailed duplexes and replication fork structures. May play a role in the extension step after strand invasion at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks; together with PALB2 is involved in both POLH localization at collapsed replication forks and DNA polymerization activity. In concert with NPM1, regulates centrosome duplication. Interacts with the TREX-2 complex (transcription and export complex 2) subunits PCID2 and SHFM1/DSS1, and is required to prevent R-loop- associated DNA damage and thus transcription-associated genomic instability.

RAF1 activation initiates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that comprises a sequential phosphorylation of the dual-specific MAPK kinases (MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2). The phosphorylated form of RAF1 (on residues Ser-338 and Ser-339, by PAK1) phosphorylates BAD/Bcl2- antagonist of cell death at 'Ser-75'. Phosphorylates adenylyl cyclases: ADCY2, ADCY5 and ADCY6, resulting in their activation. Phosphorylates PPP1R12A resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN. Restricts caspase activation in response to selected stimuli, notably Fas stimulation, pathogen-mediated macrophage apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11427728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15385642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15618521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15849194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16892053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16924233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9360956}.; 	DISEASE: Noonan syndrome 5 (NS5) [MIM:611553]: A form of Noonan syndrome, a disease characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, a downward eyeslant and low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon.

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early-onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic tumors of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I is characterized by hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II is characterized by increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon.

RAF1 activation initiates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that comprises a sequential phosphorylation of the dual-specific MAPK kinases (MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAP2K2/MEK2) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK3/ERK1 and MAPK1/ERK2). The phosphorylated form of RAF1 (on residues Ser-338 and Ser-339, by PAK1) phosphorylates BAD/Bcl2- antagonist of cell death at 'Ser-75'. Phosphorylates adenylyl cyclases: ADCY2, ADCY5 and ADCY6, resulting in their activation. Phosphorylates PPP1R12A resulting in inhibition of the phosphatase activity. Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN. Restricts caspase activation in response to selected stimuli, notably Fas stimulation, pathogen-mediated macrophage apoptosis, and erythroid differentiation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:11427728, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11719507, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15385642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15618521, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15849194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16892053, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16924233, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9360956}.; 	DISEASE: Noonan syndrome 5 (NS5) [MIM:611553]: A form of Noonan syndrome, a disease characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphic features such as hypertelorism, a downward eyeslant and low-set posteriorly rotated ears, and a high incidence of congenital heart defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair. In melanocytes may modulate both UV-B-induced cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10078208, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660545, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15064730, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17611581, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9564049, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9822680}.; 	DISEASE: Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer 1 (HNPCC1) [MIM:120435]: An autosomal dominant disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility.

The term 'suspected HNPCC' or 'incomplete HNPCC' can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10375096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10386556, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10528862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10573010, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10612836, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10777691, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10829038, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11726306, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11870161, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11920458, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12112654, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12124176, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12132870, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12200596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12362047, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12373605, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655564, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12655568, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12658575, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14635101, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15046096, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15300854, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15342696, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15365995, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15613555, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15870828, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15896463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15991316, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15996210, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16451135, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17101317, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17128465, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18561205, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18625694, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22371642, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7874129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8261515, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8700523, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8872463, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9048925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9240418, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9298827, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9311737, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9419403, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9559627, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9718327}.
