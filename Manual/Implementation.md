# Implementation

TAPES was written in python3. 

It was thoroughly tested on both Linux (Ubutun, Manjaro and Fedora) and Windows. 
Due to the lack of access to it, TAPES was not tested on macOS. However, Travis CI shows that the main sort function does work on it.

TAPES used Travis CI for continuous integration. Please refer to [this page](https://travis-ci.org/a-xavier/tapes/) for build history.
